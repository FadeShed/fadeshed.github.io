# LWP field glossary

Every `key: value` line of the article format — series, article and slide
level: where it can be set, what it falls back to when absent, what it
renders as. Reference only; `specifications.md` is authoritative, each row
links to its own §. The theme properties (`component.axis`) are a separate
vocabulary and are not listed here: `templates/settings.conf` carries them
all, commented, at the current theme's values — see `specifications.md` §9,
whose §9.1 also explains why no count of them is written by hand anywhere,
including in this sentence.
Excludes LWP's structural markers (`<!-- lwp:meta -->`, `<!-- lwp:slide:TYPE
-->`, `---`) — see `specifications.md` §4.1 for those.

## Naming conventions

**A name's shape says what level it is set at.** Settled in v0.7.0 and
guaranteed from final 1.0.0 on, for every future field too (§13.9: a frozen name
can only change in a MAJOR release). `specifications.md` §20.0 is
authoritative:

- Slide-level fields: kebab-case (`fact-label`, `highlight-caption`).
- Article/series-level fields: snake_case (`page_title`, `nav_desc`,
  `notes_placement`, `typo_units`).
- Theme properties: dotted `component.axis` (`card.title.size`,
  `verdict.yes.fg`).
- The `page_*` family covers everything about the compiled page: its
  source (`page_source`), its output file (`page_dest`), its title
  (`page_title`), its description (`page_desc`).

This is not decoration. Putting a field at the wrong level produces **no
error** — it is simply ignored — so a legible cue is worth more than a
diagnostic that will never exist. And it is what lets `resolve` take any
field name and know which cascade to consult, with no disambiguation
table: the shape answers that.

So a new field is named after its **level**, never after what looks
natural beside it. A test holds every name here to the shape its level
requires — the rule was broken four times before there was one.

Bare single words carry no shape, so they are looked up rather than
read. Every one of them belongs to exactly one level except `comment`,
which belongs to all of them and is why `resolve` refuses it: it is
parsed everywhere and read nowhere, so it has no resolved value to
report (below).

## Machine-readable draft contract

`lightwebpres contract` exposes the slide grammar as the versioned
`lightwebpres.slide-draft/1` contract. It is generated from the same
`SLIDE_TYPES` registry as the parser and reports the canonical type order,
accepted and required fields, cardinalities, empty-value rules, reserved IDs
and a complete source skeleton for each type. JSON is the default output;
`--format text` is the human view. `--article file.md` makes generated slugs
avoid the slugs already declared in that source. The command is read-only.

## Public report contracts

Public JSON reports have versioned `schema` identifiers and documented key,
type and meaning contracts; generated HTML is not a stable machine API.
Breaking report changes require new schema identifiers, including affected
envelopes. Compatible optional additions may keep an identifier, so consumers
must tolerate unknown keys (§13.9). Final 1.0.0 starts the stability promise.
Beta and release candidates invite feedback and may change before final;
neither pre-beta nor inter-prerelease compatibility is promised.

The native-identity report baseline is `lightwebpres.presentation-preset/2`,
wrapped by `lightwebpres.preset-list/2`, `lightwebpres.series-preset/2` and
`lightwebpres.series-info/4`; theme reports use `lightwebpres.theme-info/6`.
Preset reports export `native_renderer`: `true` for native Standard and
Commons, `false` for kits, even kits using native layout fragments. This is
the renderer flag, not an inferred initial selection. There is no public
`default` alias. `selector` identifies the preset, including
`builtin/standard`; `package.default_preset` names a package-local preference.
Consumers of earlier report schemas must adapt (§11.18).

## `comment` — review notes

`comment` is recognized at every level below — a `series.json` entry, the
`series_meta` object, an article's meta block, and the header of a slide
of **any** type (cover, standard, series-nav, full-article) — but never
read by any renderer: parsed, then discarded. Use it to leave an editorial note in the source (a reviewer flag,
a TODO) without it ever reaching the built output, not even in the page's
raw HTML source (unlike an HTML comment, which LWP passes through
verbatim — §6.2 — and would still ship, just invisible on screen). Free
text, no constraints, not listed again per section below.

## Series-level fields

Once per series, in `series.json`'s `series_meta` object.

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | `strings.series_untitled_fallback` (§7.3) — `series_meta` itself is optional | Series title on `index.html` and `README.md` |
| `subtitle` | `''` — omitted from the page if absent | Series subtitle on `index.html` |
| `version` | `''` — omitted from the page if absent | Version tag shown on `index.html` (e.g. `v0.13`) |
| `intro` | `''` — omitted from the page if absent | Intro paragraph on `index.html` and `README.md` |
| `author` | `''` — nothing shown | Series-wide default author (§20.3.1); shown in the index page's footer, and on every article that doesn't override it |
| `license` | `''` — nothing shown | Series-wide default license; same display as `author`; raw HTML allowed (a link) |
| `default_tag` | `default` | Tag selected when a page has no valid persisted reader choice; must occur on an article or non-excluded slide selected for the build, and warns when the effective article/slide intersection is empty. `series tags` and `status --format json` expose the resulting `default_output` too |
| `scroll_duration` | `200` ms | Duration of the deck's own slide glide. It must be a non-negative integer; `0` jumps instantly. `--scroll-duration` overrides it for one `build`, `verify` or `watch` invocation, and the presenter menu or **I** toggles between this configured value and `0` |
| `reading` | `{}` resolves to the defaults below | Strict object of initial reader choices and reduction limits, only in `series_meta`; not a theme property or article cascade (§9.3.9) |
| `lang_tags` | `{}` — no tag selects a typography pack | Object mapping a slide tag to a typography pack name, e.g. `{"fr": "fr", "en": "en"}`; the first mapped tag on a slide selects its engine (§20.5) |
| `presentation_preset` | omitted: implicit `builtin/standard` | One initial reference for the whole series and index: `builtin/standard`, `commons/<id>` or `id@MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH/preset`. Identity is inferred, not persisted separately. Both `init --preset` and `series preset set` persist an explicit selection, including `builtin/standard`; plain `init` leaves the field absent |

`slide_layouts` and `slide_chrome` belong to Identity Kit manifests, where
they declare preset defaults; they are not author metadata fields.

### Reading fields

Only inside `series_meta.reading`. All fields are optional; unknown keys and
invalid values are fatal. Runtime choices remain in the loaded page, including
when Menu closes and reopens; they are not persisted across pages or reloads.
The complete behavior is in §9.3.9.

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `table_mode` | `clip` | `clip` visually clips wide tables without deleting cells; `overflow` allows content beyond the local viewport; `scroll` keeps scrolling inside the table. Menu or **O** changes the mode |
| `text_fit` | `fixed` | `fixed` keeps native responsive sizes without content fitting; `uniform` uses one browser-measured factor for all currently visible slides, including a visible long-form article; `per-slide` measures each separately. Menu or **A** changes the mode |
| `table_shrink` | `false` | Boolean enabling independent bounded table reduction; reader-toggleable in Menu |
| `object_shrink` | `false` | Boolean enabling bounded reduction of supported images/figures, not arbitrary iframes, media players or buttons; reader-toggleable in Menu |
| `min_text_scale` | `0.75` | Minimum text-fitting factor, a finite number from `0.5` to `1`; text originally at least 12 CSS pixels also keeps that floor, while smaller authored text is not enlarged |
| `min_table_scale` | `0.85` | Minimum independent table-reduction factor, a finite number from `0.5` to `1` |
| `min_object_scale` | `0.85` | Minimum supported image/figure reduction factor, a finite number from `0.5` to `1` |

Reduction factors never exceed `1`; reaching a floor need not make content fit.
Presentation zoom is separate page-local magnification and can create overflow.
Print clears runtime scales and expands table viewports without screen clipping.

## Series root fields

In the object form of `series.json`, these keys live beside `series_meta` and
`articles`, not inside either one.

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `themes` | omitted — the essential runtime bundle is still added by default | Ordered runtime theme selectors for `build`, `verify` and `watch`; an explicit `--themes` value overrides this list (§9.3.7) |
| `presentation_presets` | omitted: a compatible kit or Commons primary also receives `builtin/standard` | Non-empty list of published runtime preset selectors; the primary `series_meta.presentation_preset` is inserted first, duplicates are removed, and native Standard is appended for a different primary unless a slide's kit-only layout/chrome override makes it incompatible. `--presentation-presets` overrides this list (§9.3.8) |

The list is build configuration, not a persisted reader choice. A reader's
presentation choice is kept in the browser session and never written back to
`series.json`.

## Language pack files

The built-in French and English packs remain one compatibility object inside
the executable, but series overrides have two canonical files:

| File | Carries | Merge behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `interface/{lang}.json` | `strings` | Key-by-key over the built-in interface vocabulary |
| `typography/{lang}.json` | `rules` | Whole rule list replaces the built-in typography rules when present |
| `language/{lang}.json` | `strings` and/or `rules` | Legacy unified override; fills whichever split domain is absent |
| `--language-file path` | `strings` and/or `rules` | Explicit unified override; highest priority |

`series_meta.lang_tags` selects typography engines only. The browser locale
selects between the embedded interface vocabularies when the build language
was not explicit; typography has already run during the build. An installed
`bin/lightwebpres` may additionally discover split packs under its FHS
`share/lightwebpres/` directory (§2.3).

## Article-level fields

One entry per article in `series.json`'s `articles[]` array. Most also
default from that article's own `<!-- lwp:meta -->` block, `series.json`
taking priority when both are set (§20.3.1).

| Field | Where it can be set | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `page_source` | `series.json` only | None — required (§20.3) | Filename of the article's `.md` source, in `sources/`. (Named `source` until v0.7.0 — the old key gets an explicit migration error) |
| `page_dest` | `series.json`, meta block | `series.json` > meta `page_dest:` > `page_source` (`.md` → `.html`) (§20.3.1) | Output HTML filename. (Named `file` until v0.7.0) |
| `page_title` | `series.json`, meta block | `series.json` > meta `page_title:` > the cover slide's own `slide_title` > the resolved `page_dest` (§20.3.1) | The article's own page `<title>` tag |
| `page_desc` | `series.json`, meta block | `series.json` > meta `page_desc:` > the cover slide's own `summary` > tag omitted (§20.3.1) | The page's `<meta name="description">` (SEO/share preview). Deliberately NOT chained with `card_desc` — invisible metadata never leaks onto visible index cards |
| `card_title` | `series.json`, meta block | `series.json` > meta `card_title:` > the resolved `page_title` (§20.3.1) | Title on this article's card on the index page |
| `card_desc` | `series.json`, meta block | `series.json` > meta `card_desc:` > the cover slide's own `summary` (§20.3.1) | Description on this article's card on the index page |
| `card_label` | `series.json`, meta block | `series.json` > meta `card_label:` > `''` — nothing to extrapolate it from (§20.3.1) | Free label (not a number) shown on the index card **and** on the "This series" nav card on every article's own page |
| `nav_title` | `series.json`, meta block | `series.json` > meta `nav_title:` > the resolved `card_title` (§20.3.1) | Title shown when this article appears in the navigation card embedded in a *different* article's page |
| `nav_desc` | `series.json`, meta block | `series.json` > meta `nav_desc:` > the resolved `card_desc` (§20.3.1) | Description shown in that same cross-article navigation context |
| `author` | `series.json`, meta block | `series.json` > meta `author:` > `series_meta.author` > `''` (§20.3.1) | Article author; shown in the page footer byline and as `<meta name="author">` |
| `license` | `series.json`, meta block | `series.json` > meta `license:` > `series_meta.license` > `''` (§20.3.1) | Content license; shown in the page footer; raw HTML allowed (a link) |
| `date` | `series.json`, meta block | `series.json` > meta `date:` > `''` — never derived from file mtime (§20.3.1) | Free-text date shown verbatim in the footer byline |
| `tags` | meta block only | No article gate | Space-separated article tags. A selected tag must match one of them and at least one non-excluded slide must accept it; an article without this field has no article-level gate |
| `status` | `series.json`, meta block | `active` (§20.6) | What this article is worth to the series. `active`: built, carded, navigated, counted. `draft`: still an article of the series and counted as one, but kept out of the normal output unless `--include-drafts`, which builds it with a centered "draft" banner. `ignored`: out of the normal chain — never built, carded, navigated, or counted for output — so an article can be set aside without deleting the entry that carries all its settings. Read-only `status` and `series tags` inventories retain it under the `ignored` count, but it never contributes to `output`. Case-insensitive; any other value is a fatal error naming the article |
| `slug_prefix` | `series.json` `series_meta`, meta block | `''` — no prefix (§12.1.1) | A namespace put in front of every slide id on the page. The article's meta block wins over `series_meta`; a value outside `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*` is a fatal build error naming its origin |
| `notes_placement` | `series.json` `series_meta`, meta block | `local` (§6.5.1) | Where note bodies land. `local`: at the foot of the unit that called them — that card, or the end of the long-form article; numbering restarts in each card. `page`: every body on the page collected into one notes section at the end, numbered continuously. The article's meta block wins over `series_meta`; an unknown value is a fatal build error naming the article |
| `notes_tooltip` | `series.json` `series_meta`, meta block | `off` (§6.5.3) | `on` also puts the body's text on the call as a tooltip. Composes with either placement and is never the only carrier — the body stays in the document, because a tooltip does not exist on a touch screen, in print, or in the reading order |
| `typo` | meta block only | Unset — typography stays on | `off` disables every typography rule (§4.5), for this article's own page only |
| `typo_units` | meta block only | Unset — rule stays on | `off` disables only the units/`×`/`≈` typography rule, for this article only |
| `typo_thousands` | meta block only | Unset — rule stays on | `off` disables only the thousands-grouping typography rule, for this article only |
| `slide_page_numbers` | meta block, `series_meta`, or `--slides-page-numbers` | `off` (§3.3.5) | Engraves the top-right `NN / NN` slide number on every slide; cascade: meta block > CLI flag > `series_meta` > `off` |

A preset cannot be selected in an `articles[]` entry or an `lwp:meta` block:
only `series_meta.presentation_preset` selects it for the whole series.

## Tag visibility reports

`lightwebpres series tags [directory]` and the `tags` object in
`lightwebpres status [directory] --format json` use the same resolved article
and slide collection as the build. The vocabulary is ordered `default`, the
series `default_tag`, then first encounter; `--tag` filters the rows without
changing the series totals.

An article counts for a tag only when its article gate and at least one
non-excluded slide accept that tag. Slides without `tags:` are `default` and
are shared by non-default selections. Each row keeps `active`, `draft`, and
`ignored` article counts, while `output` and `default_output` count active
articles and their visible slides only. `untagged` counts the non-excluded
slides that had no explicit slide tag. The commands are read-only.

## Cover slide fields

A `<!-- lwp:slide:cover -->` slide's own header. No fact-box: free text
after these fields is a fatal error (§22.12).

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `slug` | None — required on every slide; a slide without one is a fatal build error naming `series slug set` | The slide's own name in a URL, and its whole identity (§12.1.1): never its rank, never its title, so it does not move when the deck is reordered or the heading rewritten. A build error if it is not `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*`, since it becomes an `id`, a URL fragment and the tail of a shared QR code, and a build error if two slides on a page take the same one |
| `kicker` | `''` — omitted from the render if absent | Small editorial label above the slide's own heading |
| `tags` | `default` when absent or empty | Space-separated slide tags used for runtime filtering; `excluded` removes the slide at build time (§4.3.1) |
| `note` | `''` — nothing shown | Speaker note, multi-line; never rendered, surfaced by the presenter panel |
| `slide_title` — written `# Heading`, no literal field form | None. Only the first `#` before any content sets it; a bare `#` is an accepted empty title (§22.2) | The slide's own heading, rendered `<h1>` |
| `summary` | `''` — omitted from the render if absent | One-line summary paragraph under the heading |

## Standard slide fields

A standard slide's own header (default, or explicit `<!-- lwp:slide -->`).

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `slug` | None — required on every slide; a slide without one is a fatal build error naming `series slug set` | The slide's own name in a URL, and its whole identity (§12.1.1): never its rank, never its title, so it does not move when the deck is reordered or the heading rewritten. A build error if it is not `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*`, since it becomes an `id`, a URL fragment and the tail of a shared QR code, and a build error if two slides on a page take the same one |
| `kicker` | `''` — omitted from the render if absent | Small editorial label above the slide's own heading |
| `tags` | `default` when absent or empty | Space-separated slide tags used for runtime filtering; `excluded` removes the slide at build time (§4.3.1) |
| `note` | `''` — nothing shown | Speaker note, multi-line; never rendered, surfaced by the presenter panel |
| `slide_title` — written `## Heading`, no literal field form | None. Only the first `##` before any content sets it; a bare `##` is an accepted empty title (§22.2) | The slide's own heading, rendered `<h2>` when non-empty |
| `summary` | `''` — omitted from the render if absent | One-line summary paragraph under the heading |
| `highlight` | None — the whole highlight block is omitted if absent | Large standalone figure (a number, a stat, a quote) |
| `highlight-caption` | `''` | Caption under the `highlight` figure |
| `fact-label` | None — without it, the trailing free text renders as a bare paragraph instead of a labeled fact-box (§4.3) | Label on the fact-box wrapping the slide's trailing free text |
| `fact-variant` | None — the fact-box gets no extra class (§9.6.2) | Names a *meaning*, not a value: `fact-variant: warning` adds `fact--warning` to that fact-box, styled once per series by a `.fact--warning` rule in `custom.css`. Validated as a CSS class (`[a-z][a-z0-9-]*`); needs `fact-label`, without which there is no box to hang it on |
| `source` | `''` — omitted from the render if absent | Citation text, rendered `Source: <value>` (the standard academic word — unrelated to `page_source`, which is the compilation's own source file) |

## Full-article slide field

A `<!-- lwp:slide:full-article -->` slide's own header.

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `slug` | None — required on every slide; a slide without one is a fatal build error naming `series slug set` | The slide's own name in a URL, and its whole identity (§12.1.1): never its rank, never its title, so it does not move when the deck is reordered or the heading rewritten. A build error if it is not `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*`, since it becomes an `id`, a URL fragment and the tail of a shared QR code, and a build error if two slides on a page take the same one |
| `tags` | `default` when absent or empty | Optional slide tags; `excluded` removes the generated slide before rendering |
| `article` | None — required for publication; an explicit empty value warns and omits the draft slide | External `.md` file included as the article's long-form body |

## Series-navigation slide fields

A `<!-- lwp:slide:series-nav -->` slide has no author-written body. Its
navigation cards are generated from `series.json`; it accepts the shared
`tags`, `slug` and presentation fields below, and `slug` is required on it as
on every other card. `comment` is documented above because it is accepted on
every slide type and is never rendered.

## Shared Identity Kit fields

`slide-layout`, `slide-header` and `slide-footer` are accepted in the headers
of all four types (`cover`, standard, `series-nav`, `full-article`). They
override the series preset's defaults for one slide. They do not define the
page shell or navigation, and do not form an author-level JSON cascade.

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `slide-layout` | preset-owned layout default | Variant name using lowercase letters, digits and hyphens. An empty value is an error; `default` keeps the preset's default |
| `slide-header` | preset-owned chrome default | Text, a JSON model object, or exactly `""` to remove the inherited header. An unquoted empty value is an error |
| `slide-footer` | preset-owned chrome default | Same contract as `slide-header`, for the slide footer |

The preset alone owns layout and chrome defaults; slide fields override them
last. See `specifications.md` §9.9 and §20.5.3 for the manifest, fragments,
assets and validation rules.

The historical `tag:` field is not an alias for either current field. Use
`kicker:` for the visible label above a slide title, and `tags:` for tag
filtering. On a standard slide, an old `tag:` line becomes body text; on a
cover, `build` reports the unknown field and suggests the two current choices.

## Presentation vocabulary

The theme engine's terms of art — the shared vocabulary contract with
lightwebpres-gui. `specifications.md` §9 is the authoritative behavioral
description; the terms are fixed here, in English.

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **property** | One typed setting, named `component.axis` (`kicker.fg`, `cover.bg.angle`). The only vocabulary an author writes. |
| **component** | A thing the format names that the page renders — `kicker`, `summary`, `verdict.partial`. Properties belong to components; there is no intermediate semantic layer. |
| **axis** | The last segment of a property key: what it sets (`fg`, `size`, `weight`, `shadow.blur`). The axis fixes the type; the type fixes where a bare-word reference is looked up. |
| **halo** | A `text-shadow` a component sets on its own glyphs, in four axes (`shadow.fg/blur/dx/dy`). A halo is a shadow with no offset — the same mechanism, not a branch. Emitted only when a theme asks for one: `text-shadow` is inherited, so emitting it at its default would block what the page set rather than paint nothing. |
| **elevation** | A `box-shadow` a component sets on its own box, in five axes (`elevation.fg/blur/dx/dy/spread`), with an `elevation-hover` group where the component lifts under the pointer. Always emitted — `box-shadow` is not inherited, so its default paints nothing and blocks nothing. Never measured for contrast: a drop shadow falls outside the box, on a ground the theme does not own, and carries no information. |
| **shared value** | A palette colour (`color.*`) or font stack (`font.*`) themes provide and properties reference. Never read by an emitted rule directly. |
| **reference** | A word used as a value, resolved at merge time and never surviving into the output (§9.2). Bare (`kicker.fg: ink-quiet`) it is looked up in its type's namespace; dotted (`title1.fg: cover.fg`) it names another property. At most 3 hops; cycles are detected and named. |
| **layer** | One dictionary of properties in the cascade (§9.3): built-in defaults, theme, settings, article, instance — merged in that order before emission. |
| **theme** | A named layer of properties applied over the built-in defaults. It may be an embedded entry or a complete external snapshot. |
| **runtime custom variant** | The dynamic `custom(<theme>)` entry made from a base theme and the property pins in `settings.conf`; it is the primary runtime choice when those pins exist. The raw base theme remains separately selectable. |
| **theme facet** | One catalogue axis used to find themes: `family` is declared, `polarity` is derived from the background, and `hue` is computed from it. |
| **theme selector** | A runtime selection token from the effective catalogue: a slug, `all`, `essential`, or `X:Y` such as `bg:light`, `fam:terrain` or `bgh:red`; several tokens add their matches. `builtin:<slug>` forces the embedded entry when a local slug shadows it. |
| **external theme snapshot** | A UTF-8 `.conf` file containing metadata and every property in the registry exactly once. It is complete by design: no CSS and no `extends`/include mechanism. |
| **effective catalogue** | The themes visible to one operation after merging embedded, installed, user and, for a series operation, `templates/themes/` entries. A higher layer replaces a colliding slug's whole entry. |
| **catalogue root** | A directory searched for direct `.conf` snapshots: installed resources, the user root (`LWP_THEMES_DIR` or the platform default), or a series' `templates/themes/`. |
| **settings** | The author's own property layer (`templates/settings.conf`), applied over the theme for the static sheet and the runtime `custom(<theme>)` variant. Written only on explicit request: `series theme set` changes its `theme:` line, and `theme migrate` reduces an old scaffold while preserving pins. |
| **scaffold** | The generated form of `settings.conf`: every property present, commented out, at the chosen theme's values (§9.3.1). Generated once from the registry, never rewritten on the tool's initiative; `# scaffold-for:` records the theme it was generated under. |
| **pin** | Uncommenting a scaffold line (or writing one): the value overrides the selected theme in the static build and is carried by the runtime `custom(<theme>)` variant; raw runtime themes may replace it. It survives theme changes and upgrades (§9.3.1). |
| **override** | The relation between layers: a value in a later layer covering an earlier one. |
| **customization** | The author's act of overriding — via settings, per-article properties, instance tags, or `custom.css`. |
| **theme construction** | The editorial and artistic choice of palette values, fonts, shadows, and their relationships. It is catalogue work outside the renderer. |
| **measurement** | The contrast reading taken from resolved properties and composited grounds, on named sites rather than on colours in the abstract. `theme show` and `series theme` print it in full, category by category; `audit` reuses it to name a composed sheet that has stopped working, and stays silent otherwise. It reports; it never rewrites or rejects a theme, and it never reaches a built page. |
| **renderer** | The part that resolves layers, composes properties, and emits CSS/HTML. It applies the values it receives and does not retune them. |
| **article properties** | `style.<property>: value` lines in an article's meta block — the same vocabulary, scoped to that page alone (§9.6.1). |
| **instance tag** | A format-defined tag in free text — the instance-scoped fifth layer, same types as everywhere, enumerated by `audit` (§9.6.3). Inline (`{color:mark}…{/color}`, `{sc}…{/sc}`) or, for alignment alone, **block-level**: `{align:center}` and `{/align}` each on their own line, because `text-align` on an inline span does nothing. |
| **variant** | A named look for a component instance (`fact-variant: warning` → class `fact--warning`), defined once per series in `custom.css` — the source carries meaning, not visual values (§9.6.2). |
| **slide tag** | A normalized word from a slide's `tags:`. A missing value means `default`; a selected non-`default` tag keeps shared `default` slides plus slides carrying that tag. This is unrelated to article tags, instance tags, or the version tag. |
| **article tag** | A normalized word from an article's meta-block `tags:`. It gates the article card/page for the exact selected tag; an article without tags has no article-level gate. |
| **image asset** | A regular file below `sources/img/`. A standard build publishes it under `public/img/` only when a rendered page references its local `img/...` path; an existing output file is not removed by the build (§11.3). |
| **image inventory** | The audit's count of local image references in rendered pages, separated into inline images and standalone figures. It warns about unused source files and references whose source file is missing (§11.5). |
| **identity** | Resource ownership group: native `builtin` (LightWebPres) or a versioned Identity Kit. Commons is a shared resource collection, never an identity; a Commons preset uses the native LightWebPres identity. The fixed identity label names the owner, not the initially selected preset or theme. |
| **Identity Kit** | Self-contained `kits/<id>/<version>/` tree, vendored under `templates/kits/`, with a `lightwebpres.identity-kit/1` manifest. Required `label` names the identity; optional `default_preset` names a local preset, otherwise the first in manifest order is used. Owns layouts, chrome, assets, typed themes and constrained structural CSS, never the page shell. Published assets live under `public/assets/presentations/<id>/<version>/...`. `LWP_IDENTITY_KITS_DIR` sets the user root. |
| **native resource** | Built-in reusable layout `builtin:standard` or minimal theme `builtin:light`. The native preset selector is `builtin/standard`. Using a native layout inside a kit preserves that kit's chrome. |
| **Commons** | Shared resource collection, not an identity: the global theme catalogue under `themes/` (`LWP_THEMES_DIR`) plus native-layout preset descriptors under `commons/presets/<id>.json` (`LWP_COMMONS_DIR`), with series overrides in `templates/themes/` and `templates/commons/presets/`. |
| **Commons preset** | Five-field `lightwebpres.commons-preset/1` descriptor: `schema`, `id`, `label`, `description`, `theme`. Binds a global theme slug or `builtin:light` to native layouts, without a starter; selected as `commons/<id>`. |
| **presentation preset** | Named binding of a theme and layout/chrome defaults; selected as `builtin/standard`, `commons/<id>` or `id@MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH/preset`. Only `series_meta.presentation_preset` persists the initial selection, with identity inferred from that reference. |
| **resource collection** | Which resource catalogue a preset belongs to: `builtin`, `commons` or `kit`. This is separate from identity ownership and from the location where the loader found it. |
| **resource origin** | Loading scope computed by loaders: built-in, installed, user or series-local. It describes where a resource was found, not its collection or identity, and is never declared in a manifest. Kits carry no extension, inter-kit dependency, provenance, filiation or authenticity record. |
| **kit composition** | `kit compose recipe.json --output directory` validates and publishes an autonomous `directory/id/version/` tree. The strict `lightwebpres.kit-composition/1` recipe has `schema`, `sources`, `manifest`, `files`; the final manifest explicitly names every final reference. No guessed remapping or dependency closure. |
| **runtime presentation catalogue** | Ordered primary-plus-alternatives payload made by `presentation_presets` or `--presentation-presets`; it carries the rendered fragments, index variants, structure CSS and typed theme differences for the appearance picker. |
| **appearance picker** | The `C` dialogue's Identity, Preset and Theme controls. Applicable / Current identity / All filter published choices only: typed compatibility, ownership, or all published resources, not brand approval. Preset and explicit theme choices persist across pages and the index in the browser session; Follow preset resets the runtime theme override. No resource cross-product is generated. |
| **kit-qualified theme** | A runtime theme addressed as `kit:<id>@<version>/<theme>` under its owning kit (`kit:builtin/light` for native Light). All themes from selected kits are published, including those not used by a selected preset. |
| **layout fragment** | Kit HTML fragment: exactly one `{{content}}`, `{{slide_header}}` and `{{slide_footer}}` for a slide; only `{{content}}` for the index. |
| **chrome model** | JSON declaration of a header or footer, made of text, image or icon items and declared assets. |
| **furniture** | Descriptive family, not a mechanism: the properties painting the page's apparatus rather than its content or signals — rules, surface veils, sunken and control grounds, the modal scrim. Ordinary properties; the word only lets one speak of them collectively. |
| **skeleton** | The static, layout-only CSS no property drives: flex, grid, spacing, media queries. Not an editable surface. |
