# Discovery Performance

The optimizations below shipped in **2.1.22**. They reduce
duplicate work, background scan frequency, and work needed to download known
files; they do not impose a hard filesystem deadline or make network filesystems
officially supported.

## Identify the Slow Phase

A 13-second scan can be caused by remote metadata calls, sleeping storage,
large directory trees, symlink resolution, repeated traversal, or a combination.
Two elapsed-time samples alone cannot identify the cause.

Separate these costs before changing the discovery contract:

| Phase | What is measured or read |
|---|---|
| Collection discovery | Directory resolution, enumeration, eligibility, identities, and labels. `pasteberth audit` reports this duration, not the entire audit. |
| Registry installation | Opening/rechecking destinations, recovery for new destinations, filesystem identities, and group installation. |
| Zone overview | Per-zone histories and free-space information, in addition to requesting background discovery when eligible. |
| Generic item listing | Published-registry lookup and selected-zone history read with nonblocking lock acquisition. No discovery refresh/join; not a history cache. |
| Download acquisition | Published-registry lookup, shared filesystem locks, directory names and journals, selected metadata validation and payload opens. No discovery refresh or join. |
| Download streaming | Reads from retained source handles, ZIP compression when requested, and network writes; no zone locks. |
| Browser | Request latency, response processing, and rendering. Normal visible-tab polling is every 10 seconds. |

For a controlled test instance, use the documented server logging option:

```sh
pasteberth serve --config /absolute/path/test-config.toml --log-level DEBUG
```

Do not start a second daemon on a live deployment's port or storage for this
measurement. Logs include each rule's `scan=...s` and new pass-cache observations
(`resolution`, `stat`, `enumeration`), followed by overall `scan=...s` and
`install=...s`. Cache counters are not kernel syscall counters: one strict path
resolution may perform several metadata reads. Timings are emitted after the
operation completes, so they do not guarantee a report from a hung call.

Compare the browser network timings of `/api/groups` and `/api/zones?schema=items`, using the
correct authentication and deployment prefix. Groups use the last registry;
zones also read file histories and capacity. A fast groups response alongside
a slow zones response points to work outside directory discovery. The public
health endpoint does not exercise those storage reads.

Measure several runs on the actual office machine. Record rule roots, candidate
counts, cold/waking versus warm storage, and the phase timings. Avoid global
filesystem probes or recursive shell walks as a supposedly cheap health check:
they may touch the same unavailable mounts.

## Implemented Savings

- **Normalize before traversal:** strictly resolve directory aliases, then use directory identities to stop repeated traversal and cycles within each rule. Existing resolved-path matching and depth rules remain unchanged.
- **Share observations within one pass:** overlapping rules reuse resolution, stat, directory-entry inspection, and positive/negative candidate checks. Caches expire when discovery returns, so retargeted links and recovered directories are reconsidered on a later scan.
- **Keep path context:** enumeration caches use canonical paths, not just device/inode pairs. Bind aliases can expose different child mounts and must not borrow entry paths from another base.
- **Reject leaves early:** a matching candidate containing a subdirectory is rejected without inspecting the remaining entries' types. A partial leaf probe is not a complete traversal result; if deeper traversal is needed, it still happens.
- **Avoid retaining irrelevant files:** entry caches retain directories and errors, not successful regular-file records from every visited directory. The current directory is still materialized and sorted.
- **Avoid duplicate foreground scans:** mutations, directory resolution, and legacy `/images` history reads that already checked the live zone registry do not immediately scan it again. Destination identity and operation-time storage checks remain in force.
- **Reuse device locks:** registry installation creates a device-space lock only when one does not already exist.
- **Use the published registry for reads:** generic `/items` listings, content GET/HEAD on either route, and ZIP requests neither start discovery nor wait for any scan. Unlike mutations and legacy history, they accept eventual collection membership rather than rechecking global eligibility on every request.
- **Acquire only selected managed files:** retain metadata and safely opened payload handles under shared stable/directory filesystem locks, bypassing the Python zone `RLock`. Shared history reads can coexist. Directory names and transaction journals are still read, but unrelated payloads and ordinary sidecars are not.
- **Release zone locks before streaming:** HTTP serves the captured lengths in source reads of at most 64 KiB. Managed writes can replace or delete even selected names while the retained versions stream. No new per-file persistent locks, sidecar schema, or thread pool are introduced.

These are reductions in repeated work, not permission to ignore symlinks,
prune arbitrary regular expressions by lexical prefixes, or skip all mounted
filesystems. A directory link outside a collection base cannot produce an
eligible relative path, but resolving that link can itself require I/O.

## Poll Scheduling

Only one discovery refresh can be in flight. After it finishes, another
background refresh becomes eligible after:

```text
max(10 seconds, duration of the last complete refresh attempt)
```

The duration includes registry installation; the wait is measured from
completion, including startup, foreground refreshes, and failed attempts.
Background requests during this cooldown use the existing registry rather than
launch another scan. A later eligible request starts the next one; there is no
independent periodic watcher.

For example, a refresh taking 13 seconds is followed by at least 13 seconds
without a poll-triggered scan. The browser still polls, so actual starts depend
on request timing. This saves background work but can delay a new zone's
appearance. Mutations, directory resolution, and legacy `/images` history reads
ignore the cooldown and either refresh or join the in-flight scan. Continuous
traffic on those paths can therefore still cause frequent scans. Generic `/items`
listings and downloads use the published registry even outside the cooldown or
during a running scan;
they do not request background discovery either.

The cooldown does **not** cache zone histories or free-space reads. An overview,
an explicit operation, startup, or shutdown waiting for an active scan can still
block on filesystem I/O. See the [collection contract](zone-collection-contract.md).

## Known Downloads

The download path is now separate from discovery, not a target-local rescan.
A new zone returns `404 unknown_zone` until a refresh publishes it. A zone that
loses eligibility leaves the download registry when a later publication records
that removal; a download does not freshly test collection membership. The
captured destination still verifies directory identity and selected managed-file
coherence. Mutations and legacy `/images` history reads still refresh or join global
discovery before accessing the selected zone.

Acquisition is not constant-time: names enumeration remains O(n), journals still
require reads, and selected files require metadata and handle validation. It
can also wait on an exclusive writer on legacy `/previews`, which preserves
`blocking=True`. Generic content GET/HEAD and HTTP ZIP use `blocking=False` and
report `423 zone_busy` on writer contention. Generic listing likewise requests
nonblocking history acquisition and still reads the selected zone's history.
Nonblocking locking does not make directory or file I/O nonblocking.

Long ZIPs retain all selected handles without zone locks. New defaults cap this
at 64 files per archive and four concurrent acquisitions/transfers per process,
enforced by a nonblocking semaphore. A full pool returns `503 server_busy` with
`Retry-After: 1`, not the writer-lock `423`. Both caps accept positive integers
or `"unlimited"`; the existing 256 MiB source-byte and 300-second streaming-phase
limits remain. Handles and slots are released on completion, timeout,
disconnect, or failure as the handler unwinds.

The request deadline still applies during initial acquisition; while preview
or ZIP output is emitted it measures inactivity. ZIP additionally retains its
total streaming deadline. These timers cannot interrupt a blocked filesystem
call or guarantee immediate resource release from one. Retained versions are
stable against cooperating managed writes, not arbitrary external in-place
edits. See [HTTP downloads](reference/api.md#downloads) and
[storage](reference/storage.md#managed-reads).

## Why Not a 100 ms Cutoff?

A Python deadline checked between calls cannot interrupt a blocked `stat`,
`scandir`, path resolution, directory open, or capacity query. A successful
100 ms probe does not prove that the next call will be fast either.

Waiting for a future with a timeout only stops the waiting caller. The worker
may remain inside the kernel. Submitting another worker every poll would pile
up stuck operations and open resources; executor shutdown can wait for those
operations as well. A device ID is not a reliable independent failure domain,
and obtaining one may already require a blocking filesystem call.

Waking storage on one pass and using it on the next is a useful goal, but it
requires scheduling and incomplete-result semantics, not merely a timeout
around today's scan function.

## Threading And Remaining Work

This change uses existing request handling and the single in-flight discovery
job; it adds no download thread pool or independent per-root workers. Moving
blocking I/O to a pool is still a scheduling design question, not a safety or
latency guarantee. Windows backend coverage under Wine does not establish native
Windows behavior or expand the supported-filesystem boundary.

## Possible Next Steps

These strategies are **not implemented** by the current optimization:

| Strategy | Benefit | Required safeguards or tradeoff |
|---|---|---|
| Narrow roots and explicit excluded subtrees | Avoid irrelevant or known remote branches altogether | User-chosen configuration and documented path/link semantics; arbitrary regex matching alone cannot safely infer pruning. |
| Independent jobs per collection root | One slow root need not delay delivery of completed healthy roots | Fixed worker limit, at most one outstanding job per key, bounded backlog, fair retries, and generation checks. All workers can still become blocked. |
| Per-root last-good results and asynchronous history/capacity results | Extend the existing published registry to isolate slow roots and overview storage reads | Distinguish incomplete scans from confirmed removal; never interpret a timed-out empty result as deletion. Preserve overlap/conflict rules. |
| Adaptive retry delay for slow roots | Avoid repeatedly waking or probing unavailable storage | Retry only after the previous job actually ends, and periodically test recovery. Avoid permanent exclusion after one slow sample. |
| Target-local mutations and legacy history reads | Extend reduced discovery coupling beyond downloads and generic listing | Decide whether to retain fresh eligibility or adopt published membership; preserve ownership and overlapping-rule conflict checks. |
| Incremental history/capacity refresh | Reduce work even when directory discovery is fast | Account for external writers, transfers, and retention; write admission must still check real current space and ownership. |

The most useful next measurement is whether time is spent in `scan`, `install`,
or the zone overview's storage reads. Choose the next layer from that evidence
rather than promising a universal 100 ms filesystem response.
