  The exact LWP article syntax the lightwebpres tool parses: the lwp:meta
  block, the four slide types and their fields, presentation-preset selection
  and per-slide layout/chrome overrides, series.json wiring, the
  read-only status and series-tags visibility reports, and the automatic
  non-breaking-space typography. Format mechanics, not editorial
  advice. Use when writing, editing or debugging a lightwebpres .md article
  or series.json entry — including when nobody names this skill, if a
  series.json and a lightwebpres executable are present, or the text
  mentions LWP format, a slide deck article, fact-box, highlight,
  series-nav or full-article. Not for generic Markdown or blog writing, and
  not for deciding what an article says.

# Writing LightWebPres (LWP) articles

LWP is a Markdown dialect for one specific job: a scrollable article made
of "slides" (cover, fact-cards, cross-article nav) followed by an
optional long-form piece. One `.md` file per article. The tool that
builds it (`lightwebpres`) is a single stdlib-only Python script — if
it's not obviously present in the project, ask before assuming it is.
It is published at <https://github.com/Fade78/lightwebpres>; that is
where to download it from, and the only address to trust for it.

## The one idea that matters most

LWP text is **two different grammars stitched together**, and mixing them
up is the single most common way to lose content silently:

1. **Structural fields** (`kicker: ...`, `tags: ...`, `summary: ...`, `highlight: ...`,
   etc.) — each scalar field is **exactly one physical line**. The two
   review/presenter fields `comment:` and `note:` may have indented
   continuation lines; no other field does.
2. **Free Markdown text** — a standard slide's trailing body (fact-box or
   bare paragraphs, see "Slide types" below) and the full-article file.
   Ordinary CommonMark rules apply here: consecutive non-blank lines
   merge into one paragraph, a blank line starts a new paragraph.

The switch from (1) to (2) is **one-way and permanent within a slide**:
the moment a line in a slide's header isn't a recognized field, the
parser stops looking for fields entirely for the rest of that slide —
even a later line that looks exactly like `kicker: something` is just text
from then on. So: put every field before any body text, one per line,
and never expect a field to wrap.

**And a field is a value, not Markdown.** `summary: un **gras**` publishes
the literal markup. What misleads is that a field passes **raw HTML**
through untouched (`page_title: A<br>B`), so markup appearing to "work"
there says nothing about Markdown. `audit` names a field carrying a
`**bold**` pair, an `*italic*` pair, a backtick pair or a `[text](url)`
link; `build` says nothing. Write the emphasis in the free text below, or
in the full-article file.

A **duplicated field** in the same header is not an error: the last
occurrence wins, silently — deliberate override semantics (like CSS or
Make) so a build system can assemble a slide by concatenating a base
fragment and an overriding one. Headings differ: only the first `#` (on
a cover) / `##` (elsewhere) is captured as the slide's title, later ones
fall through to content.

## Anatomy of a file

```markdown
<!-- lwp:meta -->
page_title: The apple pie<br>What shortcrust pastry actually changes
nav_title: The apple pie
nav_desc: Pastry, baking, and plating
---

<!-- lwp:slide:cover -->
slug: apple-pie-cover
kicker: Recipe
# The apple pie
summary: Nine things that make or break a homemade apple pie.

---

<!-- lwp:slide -->
slug: temperature
kicker: Baking
## Temperature changes everything
summary: An oven that's too hot cooks the surface before the center is ready.
fact-label: The takeaway
highlight: 180 °C
highlight-caption: recommended baking temperature for shortcrust pastry
source: Baking guide, 2024 edition.

An oven that's too hot browns the crust while the center stays raw — the
most common mistake in a homemade pie. A second paragraph, separated by
a blank line, stays a second paragraph.

---

<!-- lwp:slide:series-nav -->
slug: series-links

---

<!-- lwp:slide:full-article -->
slug: apple-pie-long
article: apple-pie_article.md
```

- The file **must** start with `<!-- lwp:meta -->`, immediately followed by
  `key: value` lines, then a bare `---` line closing the block. Nothing
  else is allowed before it.
- `---` alone on its own line separates slides everywhere in the file —
  including inside a fact-box's free text, where it still means "new
  slide," not "horizontal rule." Use inline `<hr>` if you actually want a
  rule inside body text.
- `<!-- lwp:slide:TYPE -->` opens a slide; omit `TYPE` (just `<!-- lwp:slide -->`)
  for a standard slide.

## The meta block

Every field here is optional and falls back to something derived from
the article's own content, so a minimal article needs none of them at
all. `series.json`'s `articles` entry for this file only needs to repeat
a field when you want it to win over what's set here (or over the
content-derived fallback) — not as a rule for every entry. The full
chain, cheapest to most specific:

- `page_dest` (output HTML filename) — `series.json` entry > this meta
  block's `page_dest:` > `page_source` with `.md` swapped for `.html`.
- `page_title` (the `<title>` tag) — `series.json` > `page_title:` here >
  the cover slide's own `# Heading` > the resolved `page_dest`.
- `card_title`/`card_desc` (this article's card on the **index page**) —
  `series.json` > `card_title:`/`card_desc:` here > resolved
  `page_title` (for the title) / the cover slide's own `summary:` (for
  the description).
- `card_label` (short label on the index card **and** the "This series"
  nav block on every article's own page) — `series.json` >
  `card_label:` here > empty (no error if it never resolves to anything).
- `nav_title`/`nav_desc` (this article's card when it appears in the
  cross-article navigation embedded in a **different** article's page)
  — `series.json` > `nav_title:`/`nav_desc:` here > resolved
  `card_title`/`card_desc`.

Every field in that chain resolves to *something*, `card_label` included
(it just ends up empty) — **except `page_dest`, which has four fatal
cases**: a value that doesn't end in `.html`/`.htm`, a value that isn't a
bare filename (`sub/x.html` is rejected wherever it comes from), two
articles resolving to the same output name (compared case-insensitively),
and — in a series of **several** articles — the name `index.html`, which
is where the series index goes (§11.3.3). Any of the four stops the build
with a named error. See `specifications.md` §20.3.1 for the authoritative
version of this cascade.

A series of **exactly one** article may take `index.html`, and that is
the way to make a single article the page a directory serves: the
article gets the name, no series index is generated (an index listing one
entry adds nothing), and `build` says so on a `[no index]` line. Leave
the default name instead when the article is a brick in a directory whose
`index.html` is kept some other way — by hand, by another generator, or
because other articles already live there. The name chosen is the
statement of intent, so choose it.

You never have to reason a cascade out by hand. `lightwebpres resolve
<dir> page_title --article this-file.md` prints the value in force, the
level that decided it, and every level that did not — which is the fast
way to see that the line you just wrote is being beaten by a
`series.json` entry. The shape of the name picks the cascade: a dot is a
theme property, an underscore an article field, a hyphen a slide field.
`--format json` if you are parsing it.

**Editorial fields**, settable here or in `series.json`, with these outputs:

- `author` — falls back to `series_meta.author` for the whole series. It is
  rendered in the page footer as a byline and emitted as `<meta name="author">`.
- `license` — falls back to `series_meta.license` for the whole series. It is
  rendered in the page footer as a licence line only.
- `date` — free text, no format imposed; it joins the author in the footer
  byline only.
- `page_desc` — feeds `<meta name="description">`. Cascade:
  `series.json` > here > the cover slide's `summary`. It is the one field
  `audit` actively complains about when it resolves to nothing.
- `status: active | draft | ignored` — what this article is worth to the
  series (`active` when absent; `series.json` wins over this file).
  `status: draft` keeps it out of the output — no page, no index card, no
  navigation entry — while it still counts as an article of the series;
  `build --include-drafts` builds it anyway, with a banner on the page so
  a preview is never mistaken for a publication. `status: ignored` takes
  it out of the normal chain altogether: never built whatever the flags,
  never carded or navigated, and never counted for normal output. The entry
  survives with every field on it — which is how you set an article aside
  without losing its settings. Read-only `status` and `series tags` reports
  still retain it in the `ignored` inventory count, but it cannot make
  `output` visible. Any other value is a fatal error. `audit` is the exception:
  it examines every
   listed article, including `ignored` entries that a normal build excludes
   and drafts that a normal build omits unless `--include-drafts`; it renders
   what it can and reports it without writing output.
- `tags:` — optional article-level filter tags in this article's `lwp:meta`
  block. A selected tag must match one of them and at least one non-excluded
  slide must accept it for the article's index/nav card to remain visible.
  An article without this field has no article-level gate. `series tags` counts
  the article only when both gates have an effective intersection.

At series level, `series_meta.default_tag` chooses the tag selected on a
fresh page. It defaults to `default` and must occur on an article or a
non-excluded slide selected for the build. `build` and `audit` warn when the
chosen tag, or any other selectable tag, has no effective slide after article
gates and exclusions. A valid persisted reader choice still wins over this
initial value. To inspect the same resolved intersections without writing a
build, run `lightwebpres series tags <series-dir>`; use `--format json` for
the `default_output`, per-tag status counts, slide counts and stable
vocabulary, or `--tag fr` to keep one row. `status --format json` embeds the
same report under `tags`.

The series can also set `scroll_duration` to a non-negative integer number of
milliseconds. It defaults to `200`; `0` makes slide navigation jump instead
of gliding. `build`, `verify` and `watch` accept `--scroll-duration` as a
one-run override. In the generated page, the presenter menu's Scroll action,
or the **I** key, switches between that configured duration and `0` and
displays the active value.

**Notes fields**, settable here or in `series_meta` (the article wins):

- `notes_placement: local | page` — where note bodies land. `local`
  (default) puts them at the foot of the unit that called them: the foot
  of that card, the end of the long-form article. `page` collects every
  body on the page into one notes section at the end. An unknown value is
  a fatal build error naming the article.
- `notes_tooltip: on | off` — `on` also puts the body's text on the call
  as a tooltip. It composes with either placement and is never the only
  carrier: the body stays in the document regardless. Off by default.

**Slide-number field** (opt-in, off by default):

- `slide_page_numbers: true | false` — shows the engraved top-right
  `<span class="slide-num">NN / NN</span>` on every slide except the
  `series-nav` one (which is generated furniture, not a card). Resolves down
  the same cascade shape as the other article fields: the article's
  front-matter wins over the `--slides-page-numbers on|off` CLI flag, which
  wins over `series_meta.slide_page_numbers` in `series.json`, which wins
  over the built-in default (`off`). An invalid value is a fatal build
  error naming the article. This is **not** the always-on bottom-left live
  `X / N` counter — that one needs no setting and is never suppressed.

**A key this block does not recognize has no effect, and the build says
nothing.** `page-title:` instead of `page_title:` builds cleanly and
falls back as though you had written nothing. This is the opposite of a
mistyped *slide* field, which becomes free text and is loud on a cover
slide.

`audit` is what catches it: it names the key, says nothing reads it, and
offers the nearest real field name. It warns and never blocks, so the
build stays silent either way — run `audit` after editing a meta block.
`comment:` and `style.*` keys are never reported *as unknown keys*:
nothing resolves the first, and the second is the article property layer,
which has its own vocabulary and its own fatal errors. `style.*` is not
out of `audit`'s reach, though: a key and a value that are both valid but
compose an unreadable page — text the colour of its ground, a size under
the readability floor — get named, under this article's filename.

`comment:` here works too, for an article-wide note — same rule as the
per-slide one below: recognized, never read, never published.

## Identities, presets and themes

An Identity Kit owns inner layouts, chrome, assets, typed themes and constrained
structural CSS. LWP keeps the `<head>`, `<body>`, navigation, JavaScript and
each slide's `<section>`. A kit lives at `kits/<id>/<version>/`; a vendored
copy lives at `templates/kits/<id>/<version>/`. `LWP_IDENTITY_KITS_DIR` selects
the user catalogue. Published kit assets use
`public/assets/presentations/<id>/<version>/...`. The complete manifest,
fragment, asset, and validation reference is `specifications.md` §9.9.

Only `series_meta.presentation_preset` persists the initial selection:
`builtin/standard`, `commons/<id>` or `id@MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH/preset`. Identity
is inferred from that reference. It applies to the entire series and index;
no article entry or `lwp:meta` block may select a preset. Omission selects
`builtin/standard` implicitly. `init --preset builtin/standard` and
`series preset set --preset builtin/standard` persist that explicit reference;
plain `init` leaves the field absent. Neither native choice vendors resources.

```json
{
  "series_meta": {
    "presentation_preset": "corporate@1.0.0/brief"
  }
}
```

The `lightwebpres.identity-kit/1` manifest requires an identity `label` and
`id`/`version`. Its optional `default_preset` names a local preset, otherwise
the first in manifest order is used. The identity label stays fixed regardless
of that initial choice. `slide_layouts` and `slide_chrome` declare preset
defaults in the manifest only. Kit references are local files or native
`builtin:standard` layouts and `builtin:light` themes. Native layouts inside
a kit keep its chrome. Kits neither extend nor depend on other kits or Commons;
origins are computed by loaders, with no declared provenance or authenticity.

Commons themes are the global catalogue under `themes/` and
`templates/themes/`, configured with `LWP_THEMES_DIR`. Commons presets live
under `commons/presets/<id>.json`, installed, user (`LWP_COMMONS_DIR`), or
series-local (`templates/commons/presets/`). Their strict
`lightwebpres.commons-preset/1` schema contains `schema`, `id`, `label`,
`description`, `theme`; the theme is a global slug or `builtin:light`.
They bind native layouts to a theme, without a starter. Native Standard uses
the minimal Light theme. See the guide for complete manifest and composition
examples; `kit compose` creates an autonomous kit from explicit final references.

On **every** slide, these fields override the selected preset's defaults:

```text
slide-layout: hero
slide-header: Marque interne
slide-footer: ""
```

`slide-layout` is a lowercase/digit/hyphen variant; an empty value is fatal.
`slide-header` and `slide-footer` may be text, a JSON model, or exactly `""` to
remove inherited chrome; an unquoted empty value is fatal. These are per-slide
overrides, not an author JSON cascade, and are valid on `cover`, standard,
`series-nav`, and `full-article`. The preset theme is the typed base layer:
base theme < `settings.conf` pins < article `style.*` < instance styles, with
`templates/custom.css` as advanced final CSS.

### Runtime presentation alternatives

The primary preset comes from `series_meta.presentation_preset` (or
`builtin/standard` when omitted). A kit or Commons primary also exposes compatible native
Standard as a runtime alternative; a series may expose additional
presets at the root of `series.json`:

```json
{
  "series_meta": {
    "presentation_preset": "corporate@1.0.0/brief"
  },
  "presentation_presets": ["builtin/standard"]
}
```

`build`, `verify` and `watch` also accept
`--presentation-presets selector[,selector...]`; the CLI value overrides the
root list. It adds alternatives rather than replacing the primary. The primary
is always first in the effective ordered list, duplicates are removed, and
`builtin/standard` is the native choice. A missing or unknown selector is a
build error before output is written. With alternatives, every article and the
index carries the primary HTML plus inert runtime fragments for each alternative;
the reader changes the presentation with **C**. The choice applies to the whole
series, is held in browser session storage, and is not written to source files.

The Appearance picker has **Identity**, **Preset** and **Theme** controls.
Applicable / Current identity / All filter only published choices by typed
compatibility or resource ownership, not brand approval. All themes of selected
kits are published with kit-qualified names; no cross-product is generated.
Identity labels name ownership, while default markers name initial selections.
An explicit `theme:` in
`settings.conf` stays fixed while the presentation changes. Without one, the
preset's theme follows the selected presentation until the reader chooses an
explicit runtime theme. That choice persists until the reader chooses
**Follow preset**. Kit-only slide overrides can make implicit native Standard
incompatible; it is then omitted with a warning. An explicit incompatible
request remains a build error.

## Tags: `tags:`

On a slide header, `tags:` is a slide-level filter field, separate from the
article-level `tags:` above and from the inline instance tags described later.
Its value is one physical line containing space-separated names. Names are
normalized case-insensitively; Unicode word characters, digits, `-`, and `_`
are accepted, except a name may not begin with `_`.

- No slide `tags:` or an empty value assigns `default`, the shared slide tag.
- `tags: excluded` removes the slide during build, after its slide type has
  been validated but before the rest of the slide is validated and before
  numbering or anchors are generated.
- Other values are emitted as `data-tags="..."` on the slide section.
- In the generated page, press **L** to choose a tag when at least two exist.
  The selected non-`default` tag keeps its own slides and `default` slides,
  while `default` keeps only `default` slides. The selection is persisted in
  `localStorage['lwp-active-tag']`. The same selection gates article cards:
  an article tag is an exact match, while a slide's `default` tag is shared.
  The menu names the active tag, counts visible articles/slides, and lists
  their titles; an empty selection is announced on the page.

The source-side `series tags` report uses that same runtime rule: an explicit
article gate must match, `excluded` slides are absent, and `default` slides
are shared only with non-default selections. It is a visibility check, not a
build command, and does not rewrite the series.

The former visible-label field `tag:` is not an alias. Use `kicker:` for the
label above a slide title, and `tags:` for tag filtering. On a standard
slide an old `tag:` line becomes body text; on a cover, `build` reports the
unknown field and prints the two current choices.

If tags select different languages, declare their typography packs in
`series.json`:

```json
{
  "series_meta": {
    "lang_tags": {"fr": "fr", "en": "en"}
  },
  "articles": [{"page_source": "guide.md"}]
}
```

The first mapped language tag on a slide selects its typography pack. Slides
without one use the build-wide `--lang`/`LWP_LANG` fallback. Built-in `fr` and
`en` packs are always available; another name resolves to
`typography/<name>.json`, then the legacy `language/<name>.json`. `audit`
warns about malformed slide tags and missing mapped packs; it does not block
the build.

## Slide types

| Type | Fields | Cardinality |
|---|---|---|
| `cover` | `slug`, `kicker`, `tags`, `# Title`, `summary`, `slide-layout`, `slide-header`, `slide-footer`, `comment`, `note` | Any number, anywhere — it's a layout style, not a structural marker. No fact-box: don't put free text after its fields, that's a fatal error. |
| standard (default, or explicit `<!-- lwp:slide -->`) | `slug`, `kicker`, `tags`, `## Title`, `summary`, `highlight`, `highlight-caption`, `fact-label`, `fact-variant`, `source`, `slide-layout`, `slide-header`, `slide-footer`, `comment`, `note`, then free Markdown text | As many as you want |
| `series-nav` | `slug`, `tags`, `slide-layout`, `slide-header`, `slide-footer`, `comment` — navigation generated from `series.json` | 0 or 1 per article |
| `full-article` | `slug`, `article: filename.md` (required for publication), `tags`, `slide-layout`, `slide-header`, `slide-footer`, `comment` | Any number — each carries its own file. An explicit empty `article:` is a warned, omitted draft slide. Under `notes_placement: local` each one numbers its notes from 1, as a card does. |

`kicker`, `tags`, `summary`, `fact-label`, `fact-variant`, `source`,
`highlight`/`highlight-caption`, `slide-layout`, `slide-header`,
`slide-footer`, `comment`, and `note` are all optional — omit the line if you
don't need it. (`slug` is NOT optional — see below.) An empty scalar value
behaves like omitting it; an empty `tags:` receives `default`; the three
presentation fields follow the stricter empty-value rules above.
An empty `#` or `##` is still the slide's own empty title, not free text. The
one special incomplete value is `article:` on a `full-article`: when the line
is present but empty, `build` warns and omits that slide; when the line is
absent, the build fails. `highlight` is a short standalone figure (a number, a
stat, a quote) with an optional caption underneath; it renders above the free
text, not instead of it.

**The `slug` field** names the card in a URL, and it is REQUIRED on
every card. It is the card's whole identity: not its position, not its
title, so the link survives you reordering the deck, inserting a card,
rewriting a heading, or excluding a card with `tags: excluded`. Write a
readable one — `slug: barrage-de-vajont`. A slug must start with a letter
or a digit and may then contain letters, digits, `-`, `_` and `.`;
anything else is a build error, because the value also becomes a URL
fragment and the tail of a printed QR code. Two cards on the same slug is
a build error too, never a silent suffix.

A card without a `slug:` stops the build. `lightwebpres series slug set`
writes a random one into every card that has none — the only command in
this tool that edits the author's articles — and `lightwebpres series
slug` lists every card and the name it is published under. What that
command writes is meant to be renamed to something readable before
publication. `slug_prefix:` in the meta block (or in `series_meta`) puts
a namespace in front of every id on the page.

`lightwebpres series slug` reports those effective, prefixed names rather than
the raw `slug:` lines, so its output is the address a reader will actually
receive.

**The `source` field on a standard slide** renders a citation in a dedicated,
styled location separate from the fact content (e.g. `source: Baking guide,
2024 edition.`). Inline citations in the fact-box body are also valid
Markdown; the parser does not forbid them. Prefer `source:` for a short
reference and a footnote (`[^1]`) for a longer one, unless the series uses
another citation convention. This is a layout recommendation, not a parser
restriction. A footnote body goes to the foot of the card by default, or to
the page end with `notes_placement: page` in the meta block.

A cover slide **accepts** `fact-label`, `fact-variant`, `source`, `highlight`
and `highlight-caption` without failing, and then never renders them — you
get a `[WARNING]` — from `build`, and from `audit` too, which
renders — exit code 0, and a page missing what you wrote. Only
free *text* on a cover is fatal.

**Cover slides only accept** `slug`, `kicker`, `tags`, `# Title`, `summary`,
`slide-layout`, `slide-header`, `slide-footer`, `comment`, and `note` as their
own header fields. Any standard-slide field
(`highlight`, `highlight-caption`, `fact-label`, `fact-variant`, `source`)
is parsed but **never rendered** on a cover — the build warns and continues.
This is deliberate so you can toggle a slide between `cover` and `standard`
while drafting without a build failure. When the slide is a cover, remove
those standard-only fields; they do nothing.

`<!-- lwp:slide:TYPE -->` is validated: a misspelt type
(`lwp:slide:standrd`) is a fatal build error naming the slide's rank, the
token, and the four types.

`comment` is a review note — recognized as a real field on any slide
(and in `series.json`/the article's own meta block too), but never read
by any renderer. It never reaches the built output, not even the page's
raw HTML source — unlike an HTML comment (`<!-- ... -->`) written in
free text, which passes through untouched (still shipped, just invisible
on screen). Use it for an editorial note, a TODO, a "verify this stat"
flag — anything that must stay in the source without ever publishing.

The free Markdown text on a standard slide has two possible renderings,
picked automatically: with a `fact-label:` line, it's wrapped in a
labeled fact-box (`<div class="fact-box">` / `<div class="fact-label">` /
`<div class="fact-content">`); without one, it renders as plain
paragraph(s) — no box, no label. Use `fact-label:` when you want the
highlighted-callout look, omit it for ordinary body text.

**That free text goes through the same Markdown converter as the
full-article file** — everything listed under "The full-article file"
below works here too: tables (including the verdict classes), notes,
blockquotes, code spans and fenced blocks, links, raw HTML. Headings are
styled smaller than the slide's own big title to fit the fact-box's
frame. One trap to know about: a heading opening
the free text directly (no paragraph before it) is still just content,
*not* a redefinition of the slide's own title — but only the first `#`
on a `cover` / first `##` on a non-`cover` slide is ever captured as the
slide's title at all; a second one, or the wrong level for that slide
type, always falls through to content (§22.2 in `specifications.md`).

`series-nav` is **at most one** per article — having two is a fatal build
error, not "the second one wins." `full-article` has no such limit: a page
may pull in several long-form files, each `full-article` slide naming its
own (§22.8). An explicit empty `article:` is the unfinished form of that
slide and is omitted with a warning; a missing `article:` remains fatal. Both also
accept `tags:`, the three presentation fields and `comment:` like every other
slide; beyond that, any
unrecognized non-blank line inside either one is fatal, not ignored: a
`series-nav` slide takes no free body, and a `full-article` slide takes
`article:` plus those two optional fields.

Those four names are the whole list. A marker naming anything else is a
fatal build error citing the slide's rank, the token you wrote, and the
four names — `<!-- lwp:slide:covre -->` does not quietly become a
standard slide.

## The draft contract

`lightwebpres contract [directory]` is the read-only, versioned interface for
an authoring client. Its JSON response, under
`lightwebpres.slide-draft/1`, is generated from the same registry as the
parser and lists the four types, their fields and order, required fields,
cardinalities, empty-value rules, reserved IDs and one complete source
skeleton per type. The skeletons already contain non-empty generated slugs.
Pass `--article file.md` to avoid slugs declared by an existing source; use
`--format text` for a human-readable view. Do not duplicate this grammar in an
agent or editor.

## The full-article file

Referenced by `article:`, it's a separate `.md` file (by convention
`{name}_article.md`) with **no LWP structure at all** — just standard
Markdown: headings, `**bold**`/`*italic*`, `[links](url)`, notes
(`[^label]` + `[^label]: body` — see "Notes" below), lists, tables,
blockquotes (`> text`),
images (`![alt](img/pic.png)` — alone on its line it becomes a centered
`<figure>` block, and a standard Markdown title, `![alt](src "Caption")`,
renders as a small centered caption under the image; wrap that whole line
in a Markdown link, `[![alt](src "Caption")](https://…)`, and the picture
becomes clickable while the caption stays outside the link — so the link's
accessible name is the alt text alone, not alt plus caption;
append `{50%}` for general image zoom, or an extended suffix such as
`{width=50% height=auto align=right}`. The extended keys are `width`,
`height`, `zoom` and (for standalone figures only) `align`; `width` and
`height` use safe CSS lengths while `zoom` uses a percentage. Values are
validated before they become CSS. Mid-paragraph images accept the size keys,
but not `align`;
mid-paragraph it's a plain inline `<img>`, no caption; the path is
relative — images live in `sources/img/`, and only images referenced by
rendered pages are copied to `public/img/` at build), inline code
(`` `code` ``), fenced code blocks (` ```lang ` ... ` ``` `, the
language optional and purely informational — no syntax highlighting),
and raw HTML passed through as-is (so an author can drop in a
hand-written `<figure>` or similar if the situation calls for it).

**`&` is escaped in all ordinary text**, not only in code — so an HTML
entity you type by hand (`&rarr;`, `&nbsp;`) is published as the literal
string `&rarr;`, not as an arrow. The only place one survives is inside a
raw-HTML *block* (see below), which bypasses inline conversion entirely.
Write the character itself (`→`) rather than an entity; the format is
UTF-8 throughout.

Code goes further: text inside `` `...` `` or a ` ``` ` block is fully
HTML-escaped and shown exactly as written, even if it looks like a tag —
the opposite of how raw HTML elsewhere in this file passes through
untouched. A `>` at the very start
of a line or a backtick that isn't meant to open a blockquote/code span
can be written literally by prefixing it with `\` (`` \> ``, `` \` ``) —
the only escaping this format supports, and only needed in that
position; a `>` anywhere else never triggers a blockquote and needs no
escaping.

Four limits the converter does not announce:

- **A Markdown link must be `http://` or `https://`.** `[text](page.html)`
  or a `mailto:` matches nothing and is published as that literal text,
  with no warning. Use a raw `<a href="...">` for anything else.
- **Headings go up to level 6.** `#`–`###` are real headings; `####`
  renders as a bold-font paragraph (a sub-heading look, **not** `<strong>`
  markdown emphasis — it uses the bold typeface, not bold weight on
  emphasized text); `#####` and `######` render as plain paragraphs. None
  are left as literal text.
- **Blockquotes are one paragraph.** Consecutive `>` lines merge into a
  single `<p>` inside one `<blockquote>`; multi-paragraph and nested
  quotes are not supported.
- **Table alignment colons are accepted and ignored.** `|:---|---:|`
  parses, and changes nothing. Ragged rows are emitted as written, with
  no cell-count check.

Raw HTML at the start of a line is either an inline usage or a block,
decided per line: `<strong>Word</strong> opens a sentence.` — an inline
tag (`<a>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<span>`, `<sup>`...) closed on that same
line — is ordinary paragraph text, merges with the next line like
anything else. Leave it unclosed (`<a href="..." class="card">` opening
a multi-line card, closed by `</a>` several lines later) and every line
in between is raw HTML verbatim until the matching close, even a line
that would look like a self-contained inline usage on its own
(`<span class="caption">...</span>` alone on its line, say).

## Notes

Standard Markdown, nothing invented:

```markdown
The kettle draws about 3 kW[^kwh] on a domestic ring.

[^kwh]: Measured at 230 V, 13 A. See the appliance's rating plate.
```

Works in a slide's free text and in the full-article file. **The label is
a key, not content** — what the reader sees is a position, so you never
have to renumber anything when you insert a note.

**A label contains only word characters.** Letters, digits and `_`, accents and
non-Latin scripts included — and nothing else: no `-`, no space, no
punctuation. `[^kwh]`, `[^1]`, `[^a]`, `[^clé]` are labels. `[^a-b]`,
`[^note 2]`, `[^réf.]` are not, and they are not errors either: the
engine reads neither a call nor a body, so `[^réf.]` ships to the reader
inside the sentence as literal text and `[^réf.]: …` renders as an
ordinary paragraph with the label showing. `build` is silent and exits 0.
This is the one defect in this format that reaches the reader with
nothing raised anywhere — `audit` is what names it. If a label has to
read as it stands, wrap it in backticks.

The call becomes a link to the body; the body carries a link back to the
call. One label called twice gives one body with two return links.

**Numbering restarts with whatever unit holds the bodies.** Under the
default `local` placement that means each card starts again at 1, while
the long-form article runs continuously through itself. That is on
purpose: a card is individually shareable, so a reader can arrive at card
5 having seen nothing else, and a note numbered 7 there would send them
hunting for six that are not on their screen.

Four things `audit` will tell you about, none of them fatal:

- a label outside the word-character pattern above — reported separately
  for a call and for a body, because they do not repair the same way: one
  gets renamed, the other gets renamed *and* has been rendering a line of
  prose you never wrote;
- a call with no body — the marker still renders, but as no link at all;
- a body nothing calls — it still renders, at the end of the block,
  with no return link;
- a definition written inside a raw HTML block (a `<div class="refs">`,
  typically) — raw HTML is passed through verbatim, so it ships as the
  literal text `[^1]: …`. Put note bodies outside your raw HTML.

Practical note for `local`: notes at the foot of a card take room on a
screen that is already short. A card carrying five of them will scroll.

These footnotes are **source notes** — they are printed for the reader at
the foot of the card. They are not the speaker's cue; that is a separate
field (below).

## Speaker notes (`note:`)

A footnote (`[^x]:`) is a *source* note the reader sees. A speaker note is a
different thing: a speaking cue hidden from the normal slide view, but still
published in the page's HTML. Write it as a `note:` field on the slide:

```markdown
<!-- lwp:slide -->
kicker: Two
## Slide two
note: Mention the 2020 study — the audience asked for it last time.
  Follow up with the 2023 replication.

  If time runs short, skip the appendix.
```

`note:` is rendered into a hidden HTML element, without a footnote marker.
Press **N** to open the **presenter panel**, which shows the current slide's
`note:` text alongside the next slide's title. The panel is in the same page,
not a private presenter window: a projected or shared screen shows it too.
Anyone with the HTML can read the notes, so do not put confidential content
there. The panel follows navigation; press **N** again to close it. `note:`
is accepted on `cover` and `standard` slides.

A `note:` may span several lines: each continuation line starts with
whitespace, and an indented blank line is a paragraph break. The block ends at
the first non-indented, non-empty line (the next field or the slide body), so
the extra lines never leak into the visible slide. `comment:` accepts the same
multi-line form (it stays a review note, never rendered).

The same deck prints one slide per sheet (Ctrl/Cmd+P → PDF), with the
navigation chrome stripped and the theme colours kept, so a footnote-heavy
card and a clean handout come from the same source.

## Per-slide look: `fact-variant`

`fact-variant: warning` on a standard slide adds `fact--warning` to that
slide's fact-box classes. The source names a *meaning*; what it looks like
is defined by the series (a `.fact--warning` rule in
`templates/custom.css`), so changing themes carries the variant along.
The name must match `[a-z][a-z0-9-]*` — anything else is a fatal build
error naming the file when the fact-box actually renders (a fact-label
**and** body text). Only meaningful together with `fact-label:` (no
fact-box, no class to hook); a variant on a slide with no fact-box body
is ignored in silence, since there is nothing to class.

## Instance tags: character-level styling beyond Markdown

Format-defined tags for one-off interventions inside any free text (slide
bodies and the full-article file). They go through the compiler: a bad
value is a fatal build error naming the file, and `audit` counts them per
article — they are author decisions that survive every theme change.

| Tag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `{color:#E8A33D}…{/color}` | colour literal (3/4/6/8-digit hex, normalized to RGBA — alpha last, `#RRGGBBAA`) |
| `{color:mark}…{/color}` | a shared colour by name (`page`, `ink`, `ink-quiet`, `mark`, `call`, `affirm`, `nav`) — any name `N` for which `color.N` is in the registry |
| `{font:mono}…{/font}` | a shared stack by name (`text`, `display`, `ui`, `mono`), or a literal stack ending on a CSS generic |
| `{sc}…{/sc}` | small caps |
| `{strike}…{/strike}` | strikethrough |
| `{u}…{/u}` | underline |
| `{mono}…{/mono}` | monospace (the `font.mono` stack) |

**Alignment is the one block tag**, because `text-align` is a block-level
property: applying it to the inline `<span>` produced by every other tag has
no effect.
Opener and closer each go alone on their own line, and they wrap whole
paragraphs:

```
{align:center}
This paragraph is centred.

So is this one.
{/align}
```

Values are `left | center | right | justify`. Alignment sets alignment and
nothing else: breaking words at end of line is a separate axis,
`page.hyphens` (`manual | auto`, default `manual`), and it is never turned
on for you. Everything inside the block aligns, including table cells,
which is what makes the tag able to override a component's own alignment.
A closer with no opener stays literal text.

Tags nest, and Markdown inside them still converts. An opener without its
closer on the same line stays literal text — visible in the render. Inside
`` `code` `` spans nothing is ever a tag. Prefer a `fact-variant` or a
settings.conf property for anything that repeats; the tag is the tool for
the one place that needs it.

## Per-article style: `style.*` meta keys

Any `style.<property>: value` line in the lwp:meta block restyles that
page only, over the series' theme and settings — same vocabulary and
types as `templates/settings.conf` (e.g. `style.verdict.partial.fg:
#8A4B00`, `style.cover.bg.angle: 90deg`). A bad key or value is a fatal
build error naming the file. A good key and a good value that compose an
unreadable page are not an error — `audit` warns, naming this article and
the property, and the build still succeeds. Run `audit` after adding
`style.*` lines: it is the only thing that reads the sheet those lines
actually produce.

## Styling hooks you reach with raw HTML

Some things the stylesheet renders have no Markdown syntax at all, and
inline HTML is the documented way to reach them (spec §6.1). They work in
a fact-box and in the full-article file alike.

**Comparison-table verdicts.** Every generated table carries
`class="comparison-table"`. Put one of these on a cell — or on a `<span>`
inside a Markdown cell — and it renders with a shape marker as well as a
colour, so the verdict survives greyscale and colour-vision deficiency:

| Class | Meaning | Marker |
|---|---|---|
| `yes` | does / holds | ● filled circle |
| `no` | does not | ○ empty circle |
| `partial` | partly, with conditions | ◐ half circle |

```markdown
| Feature | A | B |
|---|---|---|
| Offline | <span class="yes">Yes</span> | <span class="no">No</span> |
```

Two more emphasize a whole column rather than a cell, applied to the
`<th>`: `col-signal` (the column that carries the comparison's point) and
`col-snap` (a column meant to be read at a glance). Reaching those means
writing the whole table in raw HTML, since Markdown cannot put a class on
a header cell.

**`.refs`** — a small-print block for a reference list at the end of a
full-article file: `<div class="refs">…</div>`.

## Raw HTML inside a field value

A field value may contain inline HTML, and `page_title` is the usual
reason: `page_title: The apple pie<br>What pastry changes` gives the
index card a two-line title. Where that value is used as *text* rather
than markup — the `<title>` element, the `<meta name="description">` —
tags are stripped and replaced by a space, so the same value reads
correctly in both places. (The index card's own title is a `<div>`, a
visible rendering: it keeps the HTML, as body content does.) Nothing
else is stripped: an unclosed tag in a field value ends up in the page.

**Trust boundary.** Raw HTML — a `<script>` included — passes through to
the published page. That is the contract for the *author's own* text: the
author already owns the page (`templates/custom.css` is appended verbatim
to it, and `template write nav.js` hands over the navigation script too).
If the markdown you
are assembling comes from a source the author does not control (a CMS
export, a database, another agent's output, a third-party translation),
sanitize it upstream before the build — LightWebPres does not filter raw
HTML and does not claim to.

## Typography: automatic non-breaking spaces

Under `--lang fr` (the default), `build` silently upgrades certain plain
spaces already present in the text to non-breaking ones: before
`; : ! ?` **and before a closing `»`**, after an opening `«`, before
`%`, around the spaced em/en dashes of an incise, between groups of 3 digits
in a number you've already spaced out (`170 000`), between a number and
`million(s)`/`milliard(s)`/`dollar(s)`/`$`, and after `×`/`≈` before a
number. Nothing to do on your end — write ordinary spaces, the build
handles the rest. It never *inserts* spacing or digit grouping that
wasn't already there (don't add a space just to trigger the rule), and a
non-breaking space you type yourself always passes through unchanged.
`--lang en` has a smaller rule set of its own — the two dash rules, a
number followed by a metric unit or a unit word, initials, and `×`/`≈` —
it is **not** rule-free. To mix
languages in one article, map slide tags to packs with
`series_meta.lang_tags`, for example `{"fr": "fr", "en": "en"}`. The first
mapped language tag on a slide chooses that typography pack; a slide without
one uses the build-wide `--lang`/`LWP_LANG` fallback. Built-in `fr` and `en`
packs are available, and another pack name refers to
`typography/<name>.json`, or the legacy `language/<name>.json`.

This alters generated content, so it can be turned off per article, in
that article's meta block: `typo_units: off` (the unit and operator
rules — numbers/units and `×`/`≈`), `typo_thousands: off` (the
thousands-grouping rules; the English pack has none, so the field does
nothing there), or `typo: off` (every rule, this article only). Each one
names a CATEGORY, so it reaches whichever language pack is in force. Leave these out unless
specifically asked to disable something — the default is what most
articles want.

## Adding an article to a series

Every article that should appear in navigation/index needs a matching
entry in `series.json`'s `articles` array — at minimum, just one
structural field:

```json
{"page_source": "apple-pie.md"}
```

`page_source` must be a **bare filename** — no `/`, no `..` — and is the
only field ever required directly in `series.json`. The array order is the
navigation/index order. `page_dest`, if you give one, must be a bare
filename too; leave it out and it's derived from `page_source` (see "The
meta block" above for the full cascade). The pre-v1.0 names
`source`/`file` are rejected with an explicit migration error.

Every other field — `page_dest`, `page_title`/`page_desc`,
`card_title`/`card_desc`,
`card_label`, `nav_title`/`nav_desc` — is read from the article's own
meta block and content by default; add one to the `series.json` entry
only to override it for this particular article without touching the
file, e.g.:

```json
{"page_source": "apple-pie.md", "card_label": "Article 3 (corrected)"}
```

An `articles[]` entry cannot select or refine the presentation preset. It is
series-wide only through `series_meta.presentation_preset`; use the per-slide
fields above for a card-specific override.

Most of these resolve down the cascade and cannot fail — but four things
here are fatal, and they are the ones worth checking before you call a
file done:

- `page_source` must end in `.md`, and the file it names must exist in
  `sources/`.
- an explicit `page_dest` must end in `.html` or `.htm`, and must be a
  bare filename.
- two entries must not resolve to the same `page_dest` (case-insensitive).
- a `full-article` slide's `article:` target must be a bare filename too,
  must resolve from `sources/`, and must exist. A symlink pointing out
  of that directory is followed by the tool and reported by `audit`.

Any non-string value for one of these fields is fatal as well.

`series_meta`, the object beside `articles`, holds what belongs to the
series rather than to one article: `title`, `subtitle`, `version`, `intro`,
`author`, `license`, `default_tag`, `scroll_duration`, `lang_tags`,
`notes_placement`, `notes_tooltip`, `slide_page_numbers`, `slug_prefix`,
`presentation_preset`. The optional root `presentation_presets` list names
runtime alternatives; it is separate from `series_meta` and is not a reader
selection. The root `themes` list follows the same build-time pattern for
runtime themes.
The first four drive the generated index page and `README.md`; `author` and
`license` are the fallback for every article's byline and licence line;
`default_tag` selects the initial tag, and `lang_tags` selects typography
packs per slide. The optional root `themes` list selects extra runtime
themes for `build`/`verify`/`watch`; it is a list of strings, not an article
field. The slugs come from the effective catalogue visible to that series,
including complete snapshots in `templates/themes/`:

```json
{
  "series_meta": {
    "title": "My series",
    "intro": "What it is about.",
    "default_tag": "fr",
    "lang_tags": {"fr": "fr", "en": "en"}
  },
  "themes": ["essential", "family:terrain"],
  "articles": [{"page_source": "apple-pie.md"}]
}
```

Each item is a theme slug, `all`, `essential`, or a facet selector such as
`background:light`, `fam:terrain`, or `bgh:red`. `essential` means Monochrome,
Monochrome Night and Print Ink; if a local file shadows one of those slugs,
the embedded version can be named `builtin:<slug>`. Several items add their
matches; an explicit CLI `--themes` value takes precedence over this list. The
`essential` bundle ships by default on every build — this list only adds to it
— and `--no-essential-theme` opts out. When `settings.conf` contains property
pins, the runtime names its first variant `custom(<theme>)` and also includes
the raw base theme; those settings pins apply only to the custom variant.
Theme choice is described here only as `series.json` wiring; palette design and
build procedure belong to the guide and specification.

A series-local theme snapshot is a complete `templates/themes/<slug>.conf` file;
`series.json` names it but never contains its typed properties.

`comment` also works as a `series.json` entry key, or in `series_meta`
for a note about the series as a whole — same rule: recognized, never
read, never published.

## Always verify before calling it done

Writing valid-looking LWP is not the same as writing LWP that builds.
Run the tool on what you just wrote — this is the only reliable way to
know it's actually correct, and it catches the mistakes above
immediately instead of leaving them for a human to discover later:

```bash
lightwebpres audit <series-dir>   # renders in memory, reports everything, never fails
lightwebpres build <series-dir>   # fatal on real structural errors
lightwebpres series tags <series-dir> --format json  # inspect tag visibility without building
```

`audit` renders the series the way a build does, writing nothing, so it
sees what only a render can say — including a series that cannot be built
at all, which it reports without stopping. It also prints the rendered image
inventory and warns about unused or missing local assets. It still exits 0 whatever it
finds: **read its output, not its exit code**, unless you pass
`--strict`. A clean `build` (exit code 0) with no `[ERROR]` lines is what
tells you the file parses, renders and ships. If the executable isn't available in this
environment, say so explicitly rather than presenting unverified output
as finished — don't guess at whether it would build.

When an article or its slides use `tags:`, read the `series tags` report before
calling the series finished. It names the stable vocabulary, the effective
article/slide intersection for each tag, the `active`/`draft`/`ignored`
counts, and the `default_output` selected on a fresh page. Its `output` count
is intentionally active-only; drafts and ignored entries remain useful in the
inventory without making normal output appear visible.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Wrapping a field value across two lines expecting it to join — it
  won't; the second line becomes free text instead (a fatal build error
  on a `cover` slide, since it has no fact-box for that text to go into
  — at least you'll get a clear error, not silent data loss).
- Writing `kicker:`, `summary:`, etc. **after** the fact-box body has
  started — those lines are already free text at that point, not fields.
  Same for a `#`/`##` heading appearing after body content has started:
  it becomes a heading rendered *inside* the fact-box, not a rewrite of
  the slide's own title.
- A bare `---` expecting a visual divider. In the LWP `.md` it **splits
  the slide**. In the full-article `.md` it does something worse: the
  line is **dropped silently** — no `<hr>`, no split, nothing at all.
  Write `<hr>` in both cases.
- Typing an HTML entity (`&rarr;`, `&nbsp;`) in body text and expecting
  it to render — `&` is escaped, so the reader sees the source. Write the
  character.
- A Markdown link to anything that isn't `http(s)` — it stays literal.
- Two `series-nav` slides in one file (the second one fails the build).
- `page_source`/`page_dest` values with a path (`sources/x.md` instead of `x.md`)
  or anything that isn't a plain filename.
- Opening a ` ``` ` code fence without a matching closing ` ``` ` —
  every line after it, including the rest of the file, is swallowed as
  code content instead of being parsed. A fatal build error catches
  this (an unclosed tag), not silent data loss, but it's easy to trigger
  by mistake when editing a code block's contents.

## Deeper reference

This skill covers only the LWP article format — writing and editing
`.md` files. It's deliberately kept narrow to stay light on context; it
does not cover installing, choosing a theme, building, verifying with
`verify`/`audit`, refreshing templates, or deploying. For all of that, if
`GUIDE.md` is present alongside this project, read it — it's the full
walkthrough, in the order it's actually needed.

For the article format itself, if `specifications.md` is present
alongside this project, it's the complete, authoritative specification
(sections 4 and 6 for the format itself, section 22 for every parser
edge case) — consult it for anything this skill doesn't cover.

Both of those documents, and the executable itself, live at
<https://github.com/Fade78/lightwebpres>. This skill may well be
installed somewhere the project isn't, so when neither file is beside
you, that's where they are.
