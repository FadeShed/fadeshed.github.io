# Operations

Read this for a workflow, not a second command manual. The current executable's
`--help` and contextual help define accepted options; `contract` defines the
versioned slide-draft interface. [Article Format](article-format.md),
[Series and Appearance](series-and-appearance.md) and
[Text and Style](text-and-style.md) retain the exact author-facing mechanics.

## Establish Authority And Ownership

Before any mission, identify its inputs, permitted changes and expected
deliverable. Locate the executable and inspect its `--version` and `--help`.
Confirm the series root, source/output directories, language, environment
overrides and runtime choices. Examples below use `my-series` as a placeholder
for that confirmed directory; invoke a local script as `python3 lightwebpres`
when it is not on PATH. Do not assume an installed skill locates the project.

Read-only inspection does not authorize modification. Source editing does
not imply deleting files, changing shared catalogues, publishing, pushing,
installing software or using credentials. Act only within the user's granted
scope. A permission failure is a blocker, not an invitation to bypass it.

The author owns `sources/`, `series.json`, pinned values in
`templates/settings.conf`, `templates/custom.css` and deliberate overrides.
The engine normally supplies navigation and built-in language packs from
its executable. Generated `public/`, the series README, `.lwp-*` manifests
and `.lwp-cache/` state are derived output, not hand-editing targets.
Review existing output ownership before building: regenerating a directory
can overwrite files, and ownership of a source does not establish ownership
of every destination. Use an agreed scratch series for a contained preview.

`--dry-run` journals intended writes and build steps without changing inputs
or output. It is useful for inspecting side effects, **not proof that the
page rendered**. `kit compose --dry-run` also validates disposable files in
the system temporary area; it is not a browser preview.

## Author And Organize

Start from the brief, local editorial conventions and authorized files.
Use `contract --article file.md` for collision-aware draft skeletons, but
complete the fields described in Article Format before building. Preserve
existing slugs when revising or reordering. Only `series slug set` writes
missing slugs into the author's articles; review its dry-run before using
that source-editing command within scope.

For a series change, compare `status`, `series tags` and `series slug` before
and after editing registration, order or metadata. Do not invent
`series article add/remove/set` commands. Changing `active`, `draft` or
`ignored` changes participation, not factual approval. Inspect per-tag
article/slide intersections and the fresh-page default, not only inventory
totals. For a corpus of several series, explicitly inventory each root;
there is no native cross-series corpus store.

The optional externally maintained `sourced-presentation` method can help
with research and editorial verification. LWP does not enforce that method
or generate researched prose. Local audience and citation rules still matter;
neither a successful render nor a status value proves a claim true.

## Select Or Compose Appearance

Inspect `kit list`, `kit show`, `preset list`, `preset show`, `series preset`,
`theme show` or `series theme` before changing a choice. Catalogue reports and series reports
answer different questions: the latter include the series' effective resources
and settings. Use `resolve` for a property whose winning layer is unclear.
`kit list` is the complete global kit inventory; `kit show` can inspect one
native or versioned kit without reading a series. Use `series preset` when the
question is which vendored kit a series actually resolves.

Choose the smallest layer that meets the brief. `series theme set` changes
`appearance.themes` while preserving settings pins. `init --preset` may apply
a kit's starter; `series preset set` changes `appearance.presets` and
selects/vendors without applying that starter, while preserving the theme
selection, pins and custom CSS. There is no theme-preservation option on that
command. Do not overwrite a shared theme or kit version merely because the
series needs a local variation.

For composition, obtain source kit roots, the final identity/version, target
manifest, desired files and authorized output catalogue. Read
`kit compose --help` and the
[identity walkthrough](https://github.com/Fade78/lightwebpres/blob/main/GUIDE.md#3-design-and-compose-identities)
for the recipe and manifest examples; specifications.md §9.9 is normative.
The recipe explicitly names the final resources: composition is not an
implicit merge, inheritance or dependency resolver. The output is an
autonomous kit, and an existing target is refused. Inspect the dry-run,
compose only in the authorized destination, then test the result in a scratch
series before selecting it in an existing publication.

Validate required layouts, chrome, assets and selected alternatives against
real cards and the index. The engine measures theme contrast per category;
it does not design an accessible identity or certify brand approval. Browser
inspection remains necessary for wrapping, contrast, clipping and asset paths.

## Diagnose And Validate

Choose the check that answers the failure, rather than rebuilding blindly:

- Unexpected title, colour or field value: `resolve` shows the deciding and losing layers; slide-field reports list their occurrences rather than a cascade.
- Missing articles/cards: inspect `status`, `series tags`, exclusions, draft flags and the effective default tag.
- Source/render warnings: `audit` renders in memory, writes no output and examines all listed articles, including drafts and ignored entries.
- Presentation-only investigation: `audit --templates` omits article checks and does not render. It is not a substitute for a full audit.
- Stale existing output: `verify` compares with a rebuild in memory, including pages, index, series README and selected presentation assets. Missing or different checked files cause failure.

Plain `audit` exits zero even for reported render failures. Read the findings;
`--strict` turns warnings and render failures into non-zero CI results.
Reports include unused/missing rendered images, malformed metadata or notes,
symlinks leaving logical roots and unreadable resolved styles. If rendering
fails, image usage can be unavailable rather than known to be unused.
The presentation section also prints the resolved filesystem path of each
selected identity kit once; the native identity is reported as embedded in
the executable. Use these paths to identify which kit tree the audit checked.
Do not infer success from plain audit's exit status.

Wide Markdown-table warnings are **ESTIMATE** findings before reader scaling
at `1024x768`, `768x1024`, `1280x720` and `1680x720`. They include resolved
size/font-size settings, longest tokens and padding, not exact browser layout
or font metrics. Custom CSS can differ; no warning is not a fit guarantee.
Try the reader's local table scroll before proposing an editorial rewrite.

For an authorized normal English-language output build:

```bash
lightwebpres audit my-series --lang en --strict
lightwebpres build my-series --lang en
lightwebpres verify my-series --lang en
```

Adapt to the actual language and options. A clean build confirms parsing and
rendering, not editorial approval or visual fit. Inspect the generated page
on desktop and mobile, including tags, links, source notes and appearance
alternatives. Read warnings even when build exits zero.

`verify` needs the same supported rendering flags and environment as the
build, including language, themes, presentation alternatives, typography,
draft inclusion, navigation, scroll duration, `--single-html [FILE]` and
`--inline-images` where applicable. Both image embedding and combined-HTML output
are reproducible by `verify`; consult `verify --help` for its accepted options.
Build-stamp differences and surrounding whitespace are ignored, not arbitrary
body differences. Audit has its own smaller option
set; do not pass build-only switches to it.

Use `verify` **before** rebuilding when the question is whether an existing
publication has drifted; rebuilding first destroys that comparison. After
an intended source change, build then verify to check the regenerated output.
If no engine or browser is available, report the missing check explicitly.

### Use Targeted Builds In Automation

When a build system knows that one article changed, it may invoke the public
CLI with either its source or destination name:

```bash
lightwebpres build my-series --lang en --incremental article.md
```

`--incremental` is a safe optimization, not a second publication contract.
The executable checks the navigation cache, shared rendering inputs, output
manifest and retained files before rendering only the selected article and
the cheap derived outputs. Any unsafe condition falls back to a full build.
Callers should use the executable boundary rather than importing internal
rendering helpers; a normal `build` remains correct when no target is known.

## Read, Present And Share

Inspect a local build before any authorized distribution. `watch --serve`
can rebuild and serve on `127.0.0.1`; launching it is an explicit local preview,
not public hosting. The page's presenter menu and built-in help document
controls. **C** opens Appearance when a real kit is published, otherwise Theme
when theme alternatives are available; **L** selects tags when available,
**N** toggles the speaker panel and **I** toggles scrolling duration.
Check the active tag and browser-persisted choices when reproducing a view.

**Menu > Display settings** (**Affichage** in French) opens the
`readingMenu` submenu with presentation zoom **-**, **+**, **Reset**, wide-table
handling, text fitting and independent table/image shrink switches. Back or
Escape returns to the main menu's Display settings item with focus restored;
an outside click closes the submenu. **D** opens or closes this submenu
directly. **O** cycles
`clip`, `overflow`, `scroll`; **A** cycles `fixed`, `uniform`, `per-slide`.
Drag to scroll a table and reach clipped columns without navigating the deck.
A brief tap or left click on plain cells instead follows bounded reading steps
through the tall slide before entering the next one; links, controls and text
selection stay native. `fixed` keeps responsive theme sizes without content fitting; uniform
reduction measures all tag-visible slides in the current article by default.
Series-wide measurement supports static content. Executable HTML, media, frames
or custom widgets in an eligible article return the control to article scope
with an explanation. Inactive measurement must not disturb active selection,
focus or media. Shell-dependent author CSS may not measure identically in the
isolated measurement documents.

In combined-HTML output only, **Uniform fit scope** appears while `uniform` is
selected: choose **Current article** or **Entire series**. Series scope uses
the smallest measured factor across all tag-eligible article slides, respecting
each article's styles, preset and settings pins. Long-form and series-navigation
slides participate even if they remain too large at the minimum. Per-slide
reduction measures each slide independently without propagating its factor.
Author limits live in `series_meta.reading`; use
[Series and Appearance](series-and-appearance.md)
for exact keys, defaults and validation. Content that still does not fit at
the floor stays available to scroll rather than being removed.

Record reading preferences separately from Appearance's unchanged session
choices. Reading uses `localStorage` per output directory path on the same
origin, across articles, the index and reloads. It saves table/text modes,
table/image shrink switches and presentation zoom, not authored minimum limits;
it never writes `series.json`. Invalid or inaccessible stored data falls back
to author defaults and 100% zoom; controls remain usable if saving is blocked.
Check storage availability, and distinguish `file:` URLs from HTTP(S): browser
policies can prevent persistence or sharing between pages.

Combined-HTML uniform scope is saved separately at
`readingPreferenceKey + ':fit-scope'`, with `article` as the fallback for
missing/invalid values or blocked reads. Blocked saving leaves the control
usable. It is not an author reading field and does not affect multipage output.

Zoom scales content fonts, line heights and images, not frame widths, padding,
borders, minimum heights or controls; it does not use root CSS zoom. Native
responsive sizing remains at 100%. Fitting is solved at 100% before manual
magnification, which can still make long content grow or scroll. Pinch remains
native browser zoom. Check resize, tags, theme/preset changes and late
font/image loading. Browser touch emulation is not a physical-device check;
report the actual test environment without claiming device verification.

Speaker notes are in the public HTML and their same-page panel is visible
on a projected/shared screen. Ctrl/Cmd+P starts slides on separate sheets;
long slides can span several. Print clears runtime fitting scales and zoom,
and expands table viewports without screen clipping. Inspect the PDF for
paper-width overflow and notes. Use effective `series slug` names
for stable article/card links and QR destinations, not ordinal slide numbers.
Confirm the intended public base URL before distributing those links.

Normal output includes separate images and kit assets: distribute the whole
intended output tree, not a lone HTML file assumed to contain every asset.
`--inline-images` on `build`, `verify` and `watch` embeds supported local
Markdown and kit images, including SVG as an `<img>` data URI with original
vector bytes, not interactive SVG DOM. Raw HTML `<img>` is not auto-inlined;
remaining relative image paths fail inline validation. SVG-as-image blocks
nested resources even online. Read its warning summary; `--verbose` adds
source, line and remediation, `--quiet` retains warnings, and `audit --strict`
may fail on them. The engine neither fetches nor rewrites these resources.
CSS, fonts, scripts and media are not a complete portable bundle. See the
[sharing walkthrough](https://github.com/Fade78/lightwebpres/blob/main/GUIDE.md#4-read-present-and-share).

### Publish A Series In One HTML File

```bash
lightwebpres build my-series --single-html --inline-images
lightwebpres verify my-series --single-html --inline-images
lightwebpres build my-series --single-html collection.html --inline-images
lightwebpres verify my-series --single-html collection.html --inline-images
```

`--unit-index on|off`, `--unit-index-max-columns N` and
`--unit-index-selector expression` are supported by `build`, `verify` and
`watch`, including combined HTML. Match them when verifying output. Unit
metadata wins over CLI, then series defaults; explicit indexes suppress
automatic insertion even when excluded. See [Article Format](article-format.md#unit-contents)
and [Series and Appearance](series-and-appearance.md#scoped-selectors).

`--single-html [FILE]` accepts an optional filename on `build`, `verify` and
`watch`; `--output` remains a directory. Without a filename, it derives one
from `series_meta.title`: strip HTML, decode entities, lowercase, fold accents
and replace punctuation with hyphens, retaining Unicode letters. An empty
result falls back to the series directory name, then `series`, not a translated
"untitled" label. Automatic stems are bounded to 100 characters and 200 UTF-8
bytes, reserved Windows names receive `series-`, and `.html` is appended.
Set `build.single_html` in the root `series.json` object to choose the default
combined filename for the series; an explicit CLI filename takes precedence.

An explicit bare `.html` or `.htm` filename always wins; paths, URLs and empty
values are invalid. `--single-html=collection.html` also works. Before the
positional series directory, a next separate value is a filename only when it
ends in `.html` or `.htm`; otherwise it remains the directory. For a directory
that looks like a filename, use `build --single-html -- archive.html`. After
the positional directory, any next non-option value is an explicit filename
and is validated. Match the automatic or explicit choice in `verify`. `watch`
rederives automatic names after title changes; use an explicit name for a
stable published address.

Without `--inline-images`, distribute copied images and presentation assets
too. Default output remains
multipage. Only the active contents/article view is mounted; switching articles
is deliberate, not continuous scrolling. Article styles, notes and IDs remain
local, and one root runtime preserves fullscreen across switches. Print uses
the active tag-filtered article; the contents view prints only series contents.

Combined HTML opens on series contents by default. Add `--no-index` to omit
that view and start at the first published unit, whether there is one unit or
several. An empty published collection fails before writes. Other units remain
reachable through `series-nav` and authored links; generated back-to-index
links are omitted. `Home` starts the current unit; `Ctrl+Home` and **Start of
series** start the first unit. Source and automatic `unit-index` slides are
unaffected. Match `--no-index` in `verify`.

Combined-HTML mode requires any `templates/nav.js` override to match the built-in
runtime and rejects nonempty `templates/index_extra.html` only when contents
are included. With `--no-index` this unused extension is ignored. Arbitrary widget
script lifecycles are unsupported; keep multipage output for those extensions.
`--drafts-only` remains refused; `--include-drafts`, `--no-nav`
and `--no-readme` are supported. `build --incremental` validates its article target
but rebuilds the entire combined file.

Source `page_dest` values do not change. Generated README links use
`collection.html#lwp/a/<encoded page_dest>`; local targets append
`/<encoded local id>`, and series contents use `collection.html#lwp/index`.
With `--no-index`, series sharing uses the physical URL without a hash to
follow future first-unit order. An incoming `#lwp/index` opens the first unit
and becomes its qualified route, never a hidden contents view.
Encode each component separately. The build manifest records the physical
combined file and copied images/assets unless inlined, not virtual article
files. Changing modes or the combined filename, including after a title change,
leaves old files recorded for cleanup; review `clean` explicitly before
authorized removal.

## Publish And Maintain

Confirm the deployment destination and approval separately from local build
authority. Publish output and referenced assets, not source notes, credentials
or the entire project by accident. The browser tool's GitLab workflow can
write to a remote repository; it is not authorized merely by a preview request.
No community hosting service or native AI publishing service is promised.

For an upgrade, record the current version, inspect overrides and compare
with `template show` before maintenance. `template write` installs an override
that stops following the embedded resource. `template update` removes an
identical local `nav.js`; a differing one is saved as `nav.js.bak` and removed
from the active path. Inspect any existing backup too. Identical built-in
language-pack copies are removed; differing packs are kept and reported.
`--scaffold` refreshes settings comments while retaining valid pins; retired
keys are preserved in a commented trailing section for review. These actions
need maintenance authority, not just a diagnosis request.

`clean` proposes manifest-based orphan removal by default; `--force` actually
removes files. Inspect the plan and confirm deletion authority first, using
the same output directory as the build. Dry-run is not permission to execute
the plan. After authorized maintenance, audit, rebuild and inspect. See
[Publish and maintain](https://github.com/Fade78/lightwebpres/blob/main/GUIDE.md#5-publish-and-maintain).

## Integrate And Automate

Use `--help`/contextual help for the running version's commands and option
placement. Do not copy a static CLI schema from this skill. A client should
consume `contract` and its schema/version rather than infer fields from
rendered HTML. JSON is available on relevant read-only reports: `contract`,
`status`, `series tags`, `series slug`, `resolve`, `theme show`, `series theme`,
`preset list`, `preset show`, `kit list`, `kit show` and `series preset`. It is not a universal
`--format json` switch for build, audit, verify or mutations.

Pass explicit paths and capture UTF-8 output, diagnostics and exit codes.
Record the version, flags and relevant `LWP_*` environment variables so a
second run can reproduce the same resource selection. A relative `--output`
is resolved against the working directory, not the series argument. Keep
credentials out of source and logs. CI should distinguish strict audit,
output-drift verification, authorized regeneration and deployment approval.

The lightweight browser tool and separate GUI reuse the engine through
Pyodide; they are not a native LWP AI-authoring API or MCP server. An external
agent/client owns its tool bridge and upstream sanitization. Consult
[Integrate and automate](https://github.com/Fade78/lightwebpres/blob/main/GUIDE.md#6-integrate-and-automate)
for deployment and browser details rather than inventing integrations.

At handoff, state changed sources/resources, outputs, exact checks and flags,
warnings, visual checks performed, and anything not published or not verified.
